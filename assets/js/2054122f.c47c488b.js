The vertebral column is instrumental to our health, activeness, and well-being.

We hypothesized this because prior researchers have found accuracies of 78.7% (Unal et. al, 2016) (2) and 78.3% (Akben, 2016) (5) when using K-NN methods on the same UCI Vertebral Column dataset.

Currently, the predominant methods of diagnosing spinal abnormalities are quite subjective and can be dependent upon the physician's experience and skills. This can be problematic since, as mentioned before, spondylolisthesis and herniasted discs have very similar general symptoms. Further, it's estimated that about 11.5% of the population has spondylolisthesis, but very few actually experience symptoms (3). Therefore, inexperienced physicians or poor reporting of symptoms can significantly impair diagnosis. With the support of data driven tools like ours, physicians can get a 'third voice' on their jobs."),(0,i.kt)("h3",{id:"impact-of-our-findings"},"Impact of Our Findings"),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"An effective model would have many significant impacts. First, it could increase the objectivity and accuracy of spinal abnormality diagnoses. Pain perception and symptom experience are highly variable between individuals, which significantly increases the difficulty of diagnosing spinal abnormalities like these. Ineffective diagnosis is costly for patients, insurers, and care providers and also may threaten patients' health. A solid classification model can then be used by both experienced and less experienced physicians to augment their clincial diagnoses, ultimately improvely the well-being of both patients and physicians. To this end, many prior researchers have built classification models using this dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Deposit, and found promising results. Specifically, Akban (2016) experimented with multiple classification strategies - including K-NN - and found that the Naive Bayes Classification in Python produced the highest overall accuracy (4), hinting at that method's potential utility.
